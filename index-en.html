    <h2><a name="whatis">What is FreeWnn?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>'Wnn' is pronounced 'un-nu'. Basic information of Wnn is
      described in (English version of)
      <a href="http://www.tomo.gr.jp/wnn/wnn_e.html">&quot;What is Wnn?&quot;</a>.
      <li>FreeWnn is derived (and GPL-ed) version of Wnn4.2,
      contributed X11 software.
      <li>FreeWnn is a client-server type Kana (pronounciation) -
      Kanji in Japanese translation system. It also converts to Hanzi
      in Chinese, both Simplified and Traditional, and Hanja in
      Korean.
      <li>Distributed under GNU GPLv2 / LGPLv2 (mainly library part)
      or later version of each licenses.  (Some of the file may
      distribute separately under more loose license. See each file
      for details.)
</ul>

<h2><a name="domains"></a></h2>
    <p>Due to service end of OSDN (former SourceForge.JP), I just put
      legacy contents to GitHub.</p>
    <p><tt>freewnn.org</tt> domain is not owned by FreeWnn Project.
      Due to service end of OSDN, contents under domains like
      <tt>osdn.jp</tt>, <tt>osdn.net</tt>ï¼ˆ,<tt>sourceforge.jp</tt>, etc.)
      are not responsible by us.</p>
    <p>If you need link to FreeWnn web pages, please link to this page
      (<a href="https://freewnn.github.io">https://freewnn.github.io</a>).</p>

<h2><a name="download">Download</a></h2>

    <p>Current (alpha) version: 1.1.1-a023</p>

    <p>Currently, I (Aono) will not make changes to FreeWnn code.  I
      imported (and converted) CVS repository in OSDN (hosted in
      m17.org in the past) to
      <a href="https://github.com/freewnn/FreeWnn-Archive">https://github.com/freewnn/FreeWnn-Archive</a>
      .</p>


    <p>NOTE: We don't officially have a client implementation
      now. (You can try uum ( terminal frontend for Japanese) by
      adding '--enable-client' with the configure script, but it is
      experimental.)  Please use (for example) Tamago (for Emacs),
      kinput2,

      <a href="http://im-ja.sourceforge.net/">im-ja</a> and other
      clients using libwnn.
    </p>


<h2><a name="maillist">Mailing Lists</a></h2>

    <p>We host no mailing-lists about FreeWnn for now. GitHub do not
    have mailing-list service.</p>

<p>freewnn-users / freewnn-cvs lists (freewnn-users / freewnn-cvs at lists.osdn.me) have been closed in 2024. (No archive of these lists for now.)
<p>freewnn ML (freewnn at tomo.gr.jp) has also been closed. (
<a href="http://www.tomo.gr.jp/users/wnn/index.html" target="_top">Part of archive</a> in Japanese)

<h2><a name="help-develop">Further Development</a></h2>

    <p>As I described, I will not make changes to FreeWnn code as of
    2025.  I will not receive pull-request to
    https://github.com/freewnn/FreeWnn-Archive for now.

    <p>If someone comes who wish to develop FreeWnn further, I will
    create another repository. If I create it in github.com/freewnn/ ,
    I will notice in this page.</p>

    <p>You will develop and distribute FreeWnn in other places under
      GNU General Public License Version 2. Their changes are
      responsible by them, please contact them about their code.</p>
